Hardware requirements: 
----------------------

The robot has to be constructed in a form that he can:
* analyse his room including different things (sensor choosing)
* navigate to specific positions after the analysis of the room
* identify a pallet
* transport different pallets to specific identified positions
* connect to a recharging unit
* robot can be controlled via Bluetooth connection (via Smartphone) or a stored automated program
* use the sensors gyro and accelerometer for navigation Project Description

Software requirements:
----------------------

* construction of the whole system using Visual Paradigm
* program implementation in Java (find the Java API and the newest versions)
* choose a program location (in robot-CPU or connection to a PC via Bluetooth)
* the robot needs to inspect the room where “he” lives
* the robot has to store the room information (obstacles, borders, recharging unit, etc.) in a data base / file system
* navigate inside the room
* calculating time until recharging
* go back to the recharging unit
* put pallets to specific positions
